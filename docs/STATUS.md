# Status — implementation and physical acceptance

**Updated:** 2026-10-12 · **State:** ROG v0.2.0 installed and running, ready for
owner listening; ThinkPad installation pending.

| Work | State | Next evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Hardware inventory | Both laptops inspected read-only | Refresh during installation |
| ASUS speaker tuning | Music/balanced candidate installed; live preset, IR, plugins and hardware output verified | Owner listening, physical hotplug and measurements |
| ThinkPad speaker tuning | Exact Lenovo XML/INF published; three bundles built | Physical listening and measurements |
| Laptop installation runtime | ROG active with private rollback; ThinkPad kit ready; inherited 97 unit cases and both isolated graph cases passed | ThinkPad coordinated install and physical qualification |
| Diagnostics and latency | 42 tests and native rule checks passed in PR 1 | Physical comparison and coordinated activation |
| Host Atmos | 15 tests and focused CI cleanup acceptance passed in PR 1 | Actual JOC reference media and physical qualification |
| macOS comparison | Pending physical measurements | M4 Air primary, M3 Max secondary |
| Sonos Arc/eARC | Deferred until internal audio work | TV route and actual received formats |

Companion to [installation](SPEAKER_INSTALL.md), [review](REVIEW.md) and
[implementation](AUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION.md). Source capability, synthetic results,
installation and measured performance remain separate claims.

## Installation readiness

Both model-specific kits passed their isolated loader/plugin/routing case
with ten assertions. The ASUS ROG GU605MZ is now installed and active on
Ubuntu 26.10 amd64. The ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 1 remains ready for a separately
coordinated installation; no package or profile has been activated there.

The package preserves stock EasyEffects configuration and uses a separate
application identity and data roots. Installation/removal has a durable file
snapshot and conflict detection. Controlled quit restores owned stream targets;
forced termination has no persistent original-target journal. Physical
headphone hotplug, restart/resume, listening, calls, power and latency remain
acceptance work. Stock amplifier firmware and protection remain in place.

Read-only APT simulations resolved the exact final package from each host's
cached metadata: 135 new packages on ASUS and 136 on ThinkPad, with zero
upgrades/removals. Installed-package inventories were unchanged. This proves
cached resolution, not successful download or installation. A fresh ASUS
baseline and private rollback records are retained. These simulations remain
historical preparation receipts, distinct from the completed ROG installation.

## ROG live deployment

The owner authorized the ROG installation and activation. The exact v0.2.0
package installed with 135 new packages and no existing-package upgrades or
removals. The installed binary hash matches the reviewed artifact, and the
runtime prerequisite inspector now reports compatible. Five managed candidate
files were installed with a durable private snapshot before activation.

The active candidate selected the ASUS music/balanced preset. Its actual IR
loader confirmed the kernel, all expected plugin nodes appeared, an existing
application stream entered the candidate and the effects output linked to the
physical speakers. The internal speaker route and physical default were
preserved. The initial speaker volume was reduced from 76% to 20%; its prior
value is retained. No deployment-generated playback or recording occurred.

Stock PipeWire/WirePlumber process IDs, amplifier controls and Cirrus firmware
hashes were unchanged. The candidate runs as a transient user service without
reboot autostart. Versioned recovery tools, corresponding source, logs and the
rollback snapshot are retained privately outside temporary storage. Immediate
bypass uses controlled quit; removal restores managed files and retains the
post-install state. Newly installed dependencies are retained on candidate
removal; no automatic dependency cleanup is part of rollback.

[The deployment receipt](../evidence/rog-speaker-deployment-2026-10-12.json)
records live operational checks. The inherited unit and isolated graph passes
were not repeated. Listening preference, headphone/HDMI hotplug, resume, calls,
power, calibrated response/distortion and physical latency remain unmeasured.
ThinkPad and Sonos were not changed in this window.

## Review and acceptance

The completed PR 2 batch received three independent adversarial reviews.
All seven findings were fixed and cleared focused source re-review before
unit execution. The Lenovo/shared speaker suite passed 55 cases, dependency
inspection nine, source staging one, installation 12 and native routing 20:
97 affected cases passed, with zero skips. The first native run encountered
20 execution errors from a noexec container mount; only those failed cases
were retried. Unchanged latency and Atmos passes from PR 1 were retained.

The ASUS graph passed on attempt five; the ThinkPad graph passed on its first
attempt. Three ASUS attempts failed on fixture export/module registration,
and one timed out without retaining the precise observation stage. Reviewed
fixture corrections and private writable session state preceded the final
pass; the earlier state warning was not established as the timeout's cause.
No graph assertion was relaxed and no passing graph case was repeated.
Production package bytes and accepted unit source remained unchanged.

[Unit receipts](../evidence/speaker-installation-unit-validation-2026-10-12.json),
[shared/importer receipt](../evidence/speaker-importer-inspector-acceptance-2026-10-12.json)
and [graph receipt](../evidence/speaker-runtime-graph-validation-2026-10-12.json)
bind the accepted code, artifacts and results. The release includes exact
corresponding runtime source and original notices.

## Recovery and implementation decisions

The original ASUS tuning came from recovery; the Lenovo tuning came from the
matching official download. The ThinkPad WinRE index contained 25,538 paths,
with no exact matching speaker XML/INF filename. Six Dolby-named DSP firmware
paths were not extracted. A reader reference-count warning limits this to
filename evidence; image authenticity was not established. The recovery
partition was unmounted and the temporary reader removed.

The repository is public. The owner requested original OEM profiles be
published with their notices; raw captures, access credentials and private
rollback records remain excluded. Original tools use MIT and third-party
terms remain separate. Work uses owned clones outside the owner's code tree.
Hosted CI is manual to avoid duplicating review-bound acceptance runs.
Music/balanced speaker candidates are the delivery default; no Mac parity,
Dolby certification or acoustic accuracy is claimed.
