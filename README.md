# rog_audio — Linux speaker quality, latency and spatial audio

Linux audio engineering for the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G16 GU605MZ, with reusable
diagnostics and offline tooling, extended to the first-generation ThinkPad X1
Extreme. Built-in speakers and everyday media come
first, measured latency against the M4 Air/M3 Max follows, and Sonos Arc/eARC
Atmos is last.

Read [status](docs/STATUS.md) for progress and evidence boundaries.
The speaker runtime and separate ASUS/ThinkPad kits have passed review, unit
tests and isolated runtime acceptance. They are ready for coordinated
installation on the inspected Ubuntu 26.10 amd64 laptops. No live audio
settings have changed, and macOS-equivalent performance or Atmos fidelity
has not been measured.

Display work remains in [rog_hdr_dv](https://github.com/pjunod/rog_hdr_dv).

## Install the speaker candidate

Download the runtime (including corresponding source), per-device kits and
checksums from [v0.2.0](https://github.com/pjunod/rog_audio/releases/tag/v0.2.0).
Follow [speaker installation](docs/SPEAKER_INSTALL.md) for checksum verification,
package dependencies, the ASUS or ThinkPad kit, a private rollback snapshot
and explicit start/stop commands. The package does not activate itself.
Use a coordinated listening window for the first activation; physical hotplug,
resume, acoustic quality and latency still need measurement.

## Install and use the diagnostics

The diagnostics and latency tools use Python 3 with its standard library.
Linux collection requires the relevant ALSA/PipeWire commands; absent probes
are reported explicitly. Speaker and Atmos builds have separate pinned
container dependencies in their build documents.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pjunod/rog_audio.git /tmp/rog-audio-work
cd /tmp/rog-audio-work
python3 scripts/inspect_audio.py --output /tmp/audio-inventory.json
python3 scripts/analyse_audio_latency.py --input tests/audio/synthetic-trials.json --output /tmp/audio-analysis.json
```

Use new output paths; existing files are not overwritten. The example analysis
uses synthetic trials, not a measurement of your machine. Collection is
read-only and never starts playback or recording. See the lane documents
for speaker conversion, client latency requests and the offline Atmos CLI.

## Recovered ASUS files

The [original tuning XML and matching INF](profiles/asus/gu605mz/README.md)
are included with hashes and vendor notices, as requested by the laptop owner.

[Licensing and attribution](LICENSES.md) distinguishes original tools from
recovered vendor files and separately fetched dependencies.

## Layout

- `scripts/` — offline tooling and repository validation.
- `probes/atmos/` — isolated spatial-audio build and CLI.
- `tests/` — generated, redistributable regression cases.
- `profiles/` — original ASUS and Lenovo tuning with matching hardware maps.
- `evidence/` — sanitized source and build receipts.
- `docs/` — maintained contracts and acceptance ledger.

## Progress

- [x] Inspect ASUS hardware and publish matching OEM tuning.
- [x] Build and validate reviewed speaker, latency and offline Atmos tools.
- [x] Build reversible installation and pass both isolated runtime/routing cases.
- [ ] Install on the laptops and qualify physical headphone/HDMI routing and resume.
- [ ] Measure built-in speaker quality and latency against the Macs.
- [ ] Qualify Sonos Arc/eARC last.
